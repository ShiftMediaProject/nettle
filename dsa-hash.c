/* Convert hash value to an integer. The general description of DSA in
   FIPS186-3 allows both larger and smaller q; in the the former case
   the hash is zero-padded at the left, in the latter case, the hash
   is truncated at the right.

   NOTE: We don't considered the hash value to be secret, so it's ok
   if the running time of this conversion depends on h.

   Output size is ceil(bit_size / GMP_NUMB_BITS).
