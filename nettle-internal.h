/* Temporary allocation, for systems that don't support alloca. Note
 * that the allocation requests should always be reasonably small, so
 * that they can fit on the stack. For non-alloca systems, we use a
 * fix maximum size + an assert.
 *
 * TMP_DECL and TMP_ALLOC allocate an array of the given type, and
 * take the array size (not byte size) as argument.
 *
 * TMP_DECL_ALIGN and TMP_ALLOC_ALIGN are intended for context
 * structs, which need proper alignment. They take the size in bytes,
 * and produce a void *. On systems without alloca, implemented as an
 * array of uint64_t, to ensure alignment. Since it is used as void *
 * argument, no type casts are needed.
